Undead MMO
==========

Undead MMO is a multi-player, top-down, zombie survival game. Official website: http://undeadmmo.com/

There is a client and server program. The game client can login to a server to play the game.

Gameplay
--------

Currently we are working on a single game mode, called endless mode:
* Zombies endlessly spawn
* Everyone is an enemy that can be killed
* The goal is to survive as long as possible from the resources on the map

In the future, there will be lots of other game modes, like:
* Waves that get increasingly difficult
* Extinction, where players that die move to the zombie team and control multiple zombies like an RTS
* Single player/co-op campaign
* And many more
