General Information:
    The code is written in C++11, so your compiler will need to support most C++11 features. GCC 4.8.1+ supports all of the C++11 features we currently use. MSVC 2012 will NOT work properly as it does not support everything we use. The code also depends on SFML 2.1. So you must link those libraries with your compiler/IDE, and have the proper include paths setup (unless you follow the easy way to build).

The client and server are different programs that must be built separately.

How to build:
    1. Download git, and clone the git repository to your computer. Read the git_instructions.txt file for more information.
    2. Download Codeblocks and GCC, and get them setup properly.
    3. Download SFML, and copy it to a folder "lib" in the root of the git repository.
    4. Copy the project files from the projects folder in the git repository to the root folder of the repository. Open the project files and click rebuild. Now everything should build and you are ready to go!

In the future we could (and should) use a build system like cmake to build everything. We will still continue providing IDE projects for easier debugging.

Platform specific build notes:
    Linux:
        Install these packages:
            git codeblocks gcc g++
    Windows:
        You can download a compiler from any of these websites:
            http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/
            http://www.mingw.org/
            http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/
    Mac OS X:
        ???
    ARM (Android/iOS):
        SFML 2.x has plans to be ported to ARM. So we will need to wait till then, or use an unofficial port.
